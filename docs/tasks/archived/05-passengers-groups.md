# Phase 5 — Passengers & groups

# Global rules (apply to every task)

- **Multi-tenant**: every tenant-owned read/write must be scoped to the authenticated org. Never trust a browser-supplied `org_id`.
- **Cross-org access = release-blocking security defect.**
- GitHub `main` is source of truth. **One task = one branch = one PR.** Never develop on `main`.
- **Append-only migrations.** Never edit an applied migration. No destructive migration without a rollback plan.
- **i18n**: no hardcoded user-facing strings; keep BS/EN parity.
- **No broad redesigns** — change only screens required by the task.
- **Verification**: API `build`+`test`, admin `lint`+`test`+`build`, browser-verify user-facing workflows. Green build ≠ verified UI.
- **Report**: branch, files changed, migrations, tenant notes, build/test results, browser verification, commit SHA, PR link.

Read `../../AGENTS.md` (repo root) and `../PRODUCT.md` / `../ARCHITECTURE.md` before coding.
